/** @brief Main Init
 *
 * This function is called from the application's main function. It gives the
 * application a chance to do any initialization required at system startup.
 * Any code that you would normally put into the top of the application's
 * main() routine should be put into this function.
        Note: No callback
 * in the Application Framework is associated with resource cleanup. If you
 * are implementing your application on a Unix host where resource cleanup is
 * a consideration, we expect that you will use the standard Posix system
 * calls, including the use of atexit() and handlers for signals such as
 * SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGCHLD, SIGPIPE and so on. If you use the signal()
 * function to register your signal handler, please mind the returned value
 * which may be an Application Framework function. If the return value is
 * non-null, please make sure that you call the returned function from your
 * handler to avoid negating the resource cleanup of the Application Framework
 * itself.
